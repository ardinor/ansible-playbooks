### Kibana ###

Installs the [Kibana 4](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) for searching and visualising logs. This role itself just installs it with no configuration. It's solely used as a dependency by the [elk stack](../elk-stack/) role.

**NB.** This role doesn't automatically start kibana4 service.
