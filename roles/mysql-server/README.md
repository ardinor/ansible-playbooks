### MySQL/MariaDB

Installs and configures a basic MariaDB (MySQL) install. On CentOS 7 it adds the MariaDB repo to install MariaDB 10.0.

Based off this [SA answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16652653).

Needs package MySQL-python (on Fedora/CentOS) for the mysql commands, which is installed as part of the role.
